# SQL-Challenge
In this challenge, I processed some data modeling, engineering, and analysis using six csv files.
The analysis was based on data from a company and its employees
For the data modeling requirements, I created a diagram showing the relationship among the different csv flies 
For data engineering, I created a SQL tables corresponding to each csv file.
For data analysis, I ran queries based on the SQL tables to determine the perform the following functions: 1.	List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2.	List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
3.	List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4.	List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5.	List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
6.	List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7.	List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8.	List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
